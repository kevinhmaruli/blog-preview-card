## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media query
- Web fonts

### What I learned

With this exercise I have learned the very basics of Figma, to match the design as close as possible. I have also had to learn how to import custom web fonts and implement a responsive design using very basic media queries.

### Continued development

I am not yet comfortable with any of the new things I have learned and outlined above. So I will continue to read up on them and apply them in future exercises and projects.
